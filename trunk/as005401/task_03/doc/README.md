# Laboratory work #3

### Student: Breschuk Dmitri

##### Task 3. Work with AXC F 2152 controller

##### Configure EclipseÂ® to program and crosscompile for the AXC F 2152

Problems which I was faced:

1: I have a notebook without RJ45 port "Xiaomi notebook air 13" because of it I had to use friend's notebook.(I couldn't find a usb to RJ45 in the laboratory which I needed)(They gave me a "The TCSMCNAM3M002P is an USB/RJ45 Connection Cable for connection between PC and drive. It is compatible with Altivar 12, Altivar 312 Solar, Lexium 32i, Lexium ILA, ILE, ILS, Acti 9 Smartlink, Lexium 28 and SoMove range." which can't work such a lan network  )

2: I installed Ubuntu on my notebook and built a project using Eclipse(2019.9R)

3:I run an Manjaro installer on my friend's notebook and configured it for work with AXC F 2152

4: After it I transferred my output file to controller and execute it
